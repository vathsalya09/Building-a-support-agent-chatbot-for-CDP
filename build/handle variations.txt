To handle variations in questions effectively, the chatbot should incorporate mechanisms to manage both size variations (e.g., extremely long questions) and relevance filtering (e.g., ignoring irrelevant queries). Here's a breakdown of how to tackle these challenges:

1. Handle Extremely Long Questions
1.1 Preprocessing for Long Questions
When a user submits an overly long question, preprocess the query to:

Truncate unnecessary details while preserving key information.
Use summarization techniques to reduce length.
Steps:
Check the length of the input.
If it exceeds a threshold (e.g., 300 characters), use NLP-based summarization.
Extract intent and key entities from the summarized query.
Code Example for Summarizing Long Questions

from transformers import pipeline

# Load a text summarization model
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")

def preprocess_query(query):
    max_length = 300
    if len(query) > max_length:
        # Summarize the query
        summary = summarizer(query, max_length=50, min_length=20, do_sample=False)
        return summary[0]["summary_text"]
    return query

# Example of a long question
long_query = """Can you please explain in great detail how I would go about setting up a new source in Segment, including every single step from logging into the system, navigating to the dashboard, finding the sources section, and then completing the configuration process?"""

short_query = preprocess_query(long_query)
print("Processed Query:", short_query)
1.2 Breaking Down Complex Questions
If the query contains multiple sub-questions:

Decompose it into manageable chunks.
Answer the primary task first and provide additional guidance for other parts.
Example Approach
Detect conjunctions or separators like "and," "or," or "including."
Split the query and prioritize the main intent.
2. Filter Irrelevant Questions
To handle irrelevant questions, implement a relevance classification system to distinguish CDP-related questions from unrelated ones.

2.1 Use a Classifier
Train or fine-tune a binary text classification model to detect relevance. The classifier should categorize questions into:

Relevant: Related to Segment, mParticle, Lytics, or Zeotap.
Irrelevant: Anything else.
Tools:
Pre-trained models like OpenAI GPT or Hugging Face's distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2.
Example Code for Relevance Classification

from transformers import pipeline

# Load a sentiment analysis model for binary classification
classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2")

def is_relevant_query(query):
    relevance_keywords = ["Segment", "mParticle", "Lytics", "Zeotap"]
    if any(keyword in query for keyword in relevance_keywords):
        return True

    # Use the classifier as a fallback
    result = classifier(query)
    return result[0]["label"] == "LABEL_1"  # Assuming LABEL_1 is 'relevant'

# Test the relevance
query1 = "How do I set up a new source in Segment?"
query2 = "Which movie is releasing this week?"

print("Query 1 Relevant:", is_relevant_query(query1))
print("Query 2 Relevant:", is_relevant_query(query2))
2.2 Predefined Rules for Immediate Filtering
Implement rule-based filtering for known irrelevant topics (e.g., movies, sports):

If the query contains unrelated keywords like "movie," "sports," or "celebrity," immediately classify it as irrelevant.
Code Example for Rule-Based Filtering

def is_irrelevant(query):
    irrelevant_keywords = ["movie", "sports", "celebrity", "weather", "game"]
    return any(keyword in query.lower() for keyword in irrelevant_keywords)

query = "Which movie is releasing this week?"
if is_irrelevant(query):
    print("This question is not relevant to CDPs.")
else:
    print("Processing the query...")
2.3 Feedback for Irrelevant Queries
If a question is classified as irrelevant, provide a polite response to redirect the user:

Example: "This chatbot specializes in answering questions about Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. For other topics, please consult a general-purpose assistant."
3. Unified Handling Flow
Complete Process
Preprocess Query:
Summarize or truncate overly long questions.
Break down complex queries.
Classify Relevance:
Apply keyword matching, rule-based filters, and/or relevance classification.
Respond Appropriately:
If relevant, process the query and retrieve the answer.
If irrelevant, respond with a polite redirection.
End-to-End Code Example

def handle_user_query(query):
    # Step 1: Preprocess query
    query = preprocess_query(query)
    
    # Step 2: Check for relevance
    if is_irrelevant(query):
        return "This chatbot specializes in answering questions about Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. Please ask questions related to these platforms."
    
    # Step 3: Extract platform and task
    platform, task = extract_platform_and_task(query)
    if not platform or not task:
        return "Sorry, I couldn't understand your query. Can you rephrase it?"

    # Step 4: Retrieve answer from documentation
    results = search_docs(platform, task)
    if results:
        return results[0]["_source"]["content"]
    else:
        return "I couldn't find information on that. Please check the official documentation."

# Test the function
query1 = "How do I set up a new source in Segment?"
query2 = "Tell me which movies are releasing next week."

print(handle_user_query(query1))
print(handle_user_query(query2))
4. Additional Enhancements
4.1 Multi-Turn Conversations
Allow the chatbot to clarify or refine the query if it doesnâ€™t understand.
Example: "Do you mean setting up a source in Segment or mParticle?"
4.2 Continuous Learning
Store user queries and flagged irrelevant responses.
Periodically review and update relevance filters and the knowledge base.
