1. Sample Code for a Running Application
 This example uses Python with Flask (for the backend) and integrates with OpenAIâ€™s GPT API to respond to user queries. It includes:

Advanced NLP to detect CDP-related queries.
Structured responses with step-by-step guidance.
A simple web interface for testing.
Steps to Test Locally
Prerequisites
Install Python: Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed.
Install Dependencies:

pip install flask openai
Code Implementation
 Python code for a chatbot that handles "how-to" questions:


from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai

app = Flask(__name__)

# Set your OpenAI API Key
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key_here"

# Knowledge base for advanced questions
knowledge_base = {
    "Segment": {
        "integrations": {
            "Google Ads": [
                "Log in to your Segment account and navigate to 'Destinations'.",
                "Add a new destination and select 'Google Ads'.",
                "Enter your Google Ads account credentials (Customer ID).",
                "Map Segment events to Google Ads conversions (e.g., 'Purchase Completed').",
                "Save and test the configuration using the Google Ads Debugger."
            ]
        }
    },
    "mParticle": {
        "features": {
            "identity_resolution": [
                "Navigate to 'Identity Rules' in the mParticle dashboard.",
                "Create a new rule for identity merging.",
                "Define primary and secondary identity sources.",
                "Save and apply the rule to your data streams."
            ]
        }
    }
}

def generate_response(platform, feature, query):
    """Generate a chatbot response from the knowledge base or OpenAI."""
    if platform in knowledge_base and feature in knowledge_base[platform]:
        steps = knowledge_base[platform][feature]
        return f"Here are the steps to {query}:\n" + "\n".join([f"{i+1}. {step}" for i, step in enumerate(steps)])
    else:
        # Fallback to OpenAI API for unknown queries
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful chatbot knowledgeable about CDPs like Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap."},
                {"role": "user", "content": query}
            ]
        )
        return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']

@app.route("/ask", methods=["POST"])
def ask():
    data = request.json
    platform = data.get("platform")
    feature = data.get("feature")
    query = data.get("query")

    if not query:
        return jsonify({"error": "Query is required"}), 400

    response = generate_response(platform, feature, query)
    return jsonify({"response": response})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
How to Test Locally
Save the Code: Save the above code as app.py.
Run the Application:

python app.py
Test the Chatbot:
Open a tool like Postman or curl, or create a simple HTML frontend to send requests.
Send a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ask with JSON data like:

{
    "platform": "Segment",
    "feature": "Google Ads",
    "query": "integrate Segment with Google Ads"
}
Example Response:

Here are the steps to integrate Segment with Google Ads:
1. Log in to your Segment account and navigate to 'Destinations'.
2. Add a new destination and select 'Google Ads'.
3. Enter your Google Ads account credentials (Customer ID).
4. Map Segment events to Google Ads conversions (e.g., 'Purchase Completed').
5. Save and test the configuration using the Google Ads Debugger.
2. Deploy the Application Online
Option 1: Deploy to Heroku
Install the Heroku CLI.
Create a requirements.txt file:

flask
openai
gunicorn
Create a Procfile:

web: gunicorn app:app
Deploy using Git:

heroku create
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy chatbot"
git push heroku main
Option 2: Use Render or Vercel
Platforms like Render and Vercel offer straightforward deployment for Flask applications.

3. Extend the Functionality
Frontend Interface:

Create a simple web page where users can input questions.
Use JavaScript (e.g., React) to interact with the Flask backend.
Rich Responses:

Add diagrams or charts using libraries like D3.js or Chart.js.
Include links to relevant documentation.
Error Handling:

Improve responses for unsupported platforms or features.
Provide fallback suggestions when a query is unclear.
Scaling:

Integrate caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently asked questions.
Use cloud services like AWS or Azure for larger deployments.
