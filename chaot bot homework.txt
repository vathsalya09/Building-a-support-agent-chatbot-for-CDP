Introduction
I clearly  read the assginment description and arrived at an understanding ,here is a brief pointers so as to make sure I don't miss on anything important.

Most of the code I have written would be lengthy, so I made sure the README doesn't :D. Everything would mostly be in bullets hereafter:
Unittests are written keeping in mind all edge cases that could occur, there are positive as well as negative test cases. Coverage too is kept above 80%.
This README will talk about the technical parts first, then about the solution. And later about all miscellenous things, which are although technical, yet I put them in the "non-technical" bracket. They talk more about my thinking and approach towards the solution, and a brief discussion on the design is also present.



Installation and How to Run the CDP Chatbot Code
Below are step-by-step instructions to install and run the CDP Chatbot locally.

1. Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:

Python (Version 3.8 or higher)
Pip (Python package manager)
Node.js and npm (Optional: If a separate frontend is used)
Git (For cloning the repository)
2. Clone the Repository
Use Git to clone the project:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cdp-chatbot.git
cd cdp-chatbot
3. Set Up the Backend
Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a Python virtual environment:


# For macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the Python dependencies from requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root and add the following:


FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
Replace your_openai_api_key_here with your OpenAI GPT API key.

Step 4: Initialize the Database
(Optional, if the app uses a database):


flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
4. Start the Backend
Run the Flask application:


flask run
The backend should now be running at:


http://127.0.0.1:5000
5. Set Up the Frontend
If a separate frontend is included (e.g., React or static files):

Step 1: Navigate to the Frontend Directory

cd static/
Step 2: Install Dependencies

npm install
Step 3: Start the Frontend

npm start
The frontend should now be running at:


http://localhost:3000
6. Test the Application
Open the frontend in your browser (if applicable).
Use tools like Postman or cURL to test API endpoints directly.
Example with cURL:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/ask \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "platform": "Segment",
  "query": "How do I set up a new source?"
}'
7. Deployment
To deploy the chatbot:

Use Heroku, Render, or AWS for hosting the backend.
For Heroku:
Install Heroku CLI: npm install -g heroku
Login: heroku login
Deploy:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
heroku create
git push heroku main
8. Additional Notes
Testing: Run tests with:

pytest
Documentation: Access API documentation (if implemented with Swagger) at:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs











Here’s a brief solution to implement and test the chatbot
1. Backend Implementation
Use Python + Flask for the server.
Implement an endpoint (/ask) that:
Accepts JSON input with platform, feature, and query.
Searches a predefined knowledge base for advanced CDP-related steps.
Falls back to OpenAI GPT API for unknown queries.
Store platform-specific features and steps (e.g., integrations) in the knowledge base.
2. Local Testing
Save the Python code as app.py.
Install dependencies:

pip install flask openai
Run the app:

python app.py
Test using Postman or curl:
Send a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ask.
Example JSON input:

{
    "platform": "Segment",
    "feature": "Google Ads",
    "query": "integrate Segment with Google Ads"
}
3. Deployment
Option 1: Deploy on Heroku.
Add requirements.txt and Procfile.
Push to Heroku using Git.
Option 2: Use Render or Vercel for easy deployment of Flask apps.
4. Extend Functionality
Frontend: Build a web interface using React or plain HTML/JavaScript.
Advanced Features:
Add visual aids (diagrams or charts).
Include documentation links in responses.
Handle unsupported queries gracefully.
Caching: Use Redis for frequent queries to reduce API calls.





Solution Overview for a CDP How-To Chatbot
This chatbot provides guidance on advanced tasks in Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. Here's the plan:

1. Core Features
"How-to" Questions: Responds to user queries like "How do I set up a source in Segment?" using predefined workflows or AI-based answers.
Cross-CDP Comparisons: Explains differences in features or processes between CDPs.
Advanced Tasks: Handles complex configurations (e.g., integrations or audience segmentation).
Dynamic Information Retrieval: Extracts relevant information from official documentation when needed.
2. Technical Approach
Backend:
Use Python (Flask) to build the API.
Implement a knowledge base for common tasks and fallback to the OpenAI GPT API for dynamic answers.
Frontend:
Create a web interface for user interactions using React or plain HTML/JavaScript.
Data Handling:
Predefine workflows for CDP features in JSON format.
Support both structured answers and conversational responses.
3. Deployment
Deploy the chatbot on Heroku, Render, or Vercel for public access.
Ensure scalability with cloud hosting and caching (e.g., Redis) for frequent queries.
4. Future Enhancements
Add data visualization for metrics and steps.
Support integration with Slack, Teams, or other platforms for accessibility.
Enable saving and exporting of query results for users.
This solution ensures accurate, scalable, and user-friendly CDP guidance.

Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram Overview
Users are associated with Queries and Sessions (optional if you want user authentication).
Knowledge Base provides predefined responses tied to platforms and features.
Queries store user inputs and the chatbot’s responses.
Logs monitor the system’s performance and errors.
Database Options
Relational Database: Use PostgreSQL or MySQL for structured and queryable data.
NoSQL Database: Use MongoDB for flexible, JSON-based knowledge base storage.
Hybrid Approach: Use a relational database for users and queries, and a NoSQL database for the knowledge base.

Scalability: Use Redis for caching frequently asked questions to reduce API call latency.
Deployment: Use RESTful principles, and host on Heroku, AWS, or Render.


Feedback
 Even though the assignment was a bit lengthy, it has many tricky parts which are easier said than done and could be tackled . The availability gaurantee, redundancy mechanism, caching for efficient reads, couldn't be addressed in such a short span of time.
